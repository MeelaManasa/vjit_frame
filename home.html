The campus mainly consists of three blocks: "A", "B" and the main block. The main
block is the newest with three sub-blocks named the Central "C", South "S" and North
"N" blocks. The "A", "B" blocks are exclusively for the first-years. This is to keep them
safe from ragging. The institute follows a strict anti-ragging policy and thus shields the
freshers from any such incidents.
The South "S-Block" is for the Mechanical Engineering department, Electronics and
Communication Engineering department and B-Block forInformation Technology
department . The North "N-Block" is for Computer Science Engineering and Electrical
and Electronics Engineering departments. The central "C-block" is exclusively for
administration. It consists of a Library, Seminar halls, Principal's office, Secretary's
office and other offices of the college administration.
Vidya Jyothi Institute of technology ranks number six among all the colleges in
the Hyderabad city, excluding the universities.Infractructure</b>
