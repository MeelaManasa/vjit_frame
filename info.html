Balaji Temple from Mrugavani National Park.

block is the newest with three sub-blocks named the Central "C", South "S" and North
"N" blocks. The "A", "B" blocks are exclusively for the first-years. This is to keep them
safe from ragging. The institute follows a strict anti-ragging policy and thus shields the
freshers from any such incidents.

Communication Engineering department and B-Block forInformation Technology
department . The North "N-Block" is for Computer Science Engineering and Electrical
and Electronics Engineering departments. The central "C-block" is exclusively for
administration. It consists of a Library, Seminar halls, Principal's office, Secretary's
office and other offices of the college administration.

the Hyderabad city, excluding the universities.
